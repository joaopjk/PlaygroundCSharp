- Higly performant inter-service communication
- Modern distributed system
- HTTP/2 as base transport protocol and ProtoBuf encoding
- First-class support for creating gRPC services with Asp.Net 5
- Microsoft has added first class support for creating gRPC services with Asp.Net 5

What is gRPC ?
- Framework efficiently connect services and build distributed systems
- gRPC(Remote Procedure Calls)
- HTTP/2 protocol to transport binary messages
- Protocol buffers, also known as protobuf files
- Cross-platform client and server bindings

How gRPC works ? 
 - directly call a method on a server
 - build distributed applications and services
 - defining a service that specifies methods that can be called remotely
 - can be written in any language that gRPC supports

 Working with protocol buffers
 - gRPC uses protocol buffers by default
 - protocol buffers are google's open source mechanism for serializing structures data
 - serialize in a proto file with the extensions .prop
 - series of name-value pairs

 Advantages of gRPC
 - Using HTTP/2
 - Binary serialization
 - Supporting a wide audience with multi-language/platform support
 - Open source and the powerful community behind it
 - Support bi-directional streaming operations

 gRPC usage of Microservices Communication
 - Synchronois backend ms-to-ms communications
 - Polyglot environments
 - Low latency and high throughput communication
 - Point-to-point real-time communication
 - Network constrained environments
