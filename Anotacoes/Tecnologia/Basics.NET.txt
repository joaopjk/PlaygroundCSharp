.Net 
- Application Development Platform, to build desktop, web and mobile apps.
- Provides fully managed, secured application exectuion environment
- Supports multiple languages such as C#, VB, VC++ and etc
- Secured execution envirnoment for running application calling CLR
- Wide variety of applications and languages 
- Code re-usability
- Has two modules C#(.NET) and ASP

Application Source Code(C#,VB) -> IL(Microsoft Intermediate Language)(CSC) -> CLR(Commom Language Runtime) -> Native Code Machine

CLI
Execution engine for all .Net programs

CLR: Commom Language Runtime
- Execution Engine for all .net languages
- Code-Execution Environment that executes all types of .net applications
- Applications developed in any .net language runs based on CLR only
- CLR is a part of .NetFramework, pre installed in windows
- Components:
	Class Loader:
		- Loading classes from compiled source code to memory
		- Loads a class, when it is needed(befored creating object)
	Memory Manager:
		- Allocating necessary memory for objects
		- When an object created in the code, certain amount of memory will be allocated for the object in application's "heap"
	Gargabe Collector:
		- Freeing(deleting) memory of objects
		- Identifies all unreferenced objects and delete them in memory (RAM)
	Jit Compiler:
		- Convert the MSIL Code into Native Machine Language
		- Compiles the of a class, when it is needed(before executing tha particular class)
	Exception Manager:
		- Raise notifications while run-time errors 
		- Creates exception logs
	Thread Manager:
		- Create threads(background process) to execute the code
		- The entire program is treated as "Main thread"
		- Developer can create sub threads(child threads) to do backgroun processes
	Security Manager:
		- Verifies wether the application has permission to access system resources or not
		- Before executing the application, it verifies whether the application has not attacked by malicious programs and has necessary
		permissions to access files / folders and hardware resources

FCL(Framework Class Library) : OO Collection of classes that are used to develop applications
.Net Framework Architecture: CLR + FCL(Framework Class Library)(Like System namespace)
- Languages that have support the .NET
- All thats languages with support the .NET has based on CLS(Commom Languages Specification: A set of rules or guidelines based on wich all the .Net languages have been developed)
- Cls is developed based on the predefined libraries, like : WindowsForm,Asp.Net,WPF and etc.
- All the libraries are developed based ADO.Net, wich used for database connections
- ADO.Net is developed based on "Base Class Library"
- BCL developed based on Commom Language Runtime

BCL
- Contains a set of pre-defined classes that can be used in all types of .net applications and languages for general I/O operations, type
conversion, creation of threads and etc. Exemples: Console, String, StringBuilder, Convert, Thread, Task, etc

ADO.Net
- Contains a set pre-defined classes that can be used in all types of .net applications and languages for connecting to databases,retrieving
data from databases, inserting, updating, deleting rows and etc. Examples: SqlConnection, SqlCommand, SqlAdapter, SqlDataReader and etc

Win Forms
- Contains a set pre-defined classes that can be used in Windows GUI applications for development of GUI elements such as form, textbox, 
button, checkbox, radio button, dropdownlist and etc

CLS: Commom Language Specification
- Contains a set of rules(concepts) that are commom to all .net languages such as C# .NET,VB.Net and etc

CTS: Commom Type System:
- Contais data types such as Int32, Int64, Single, Double and etc

.NetCore
- Microsoft's Application Development Platform to develop any Desktop, web, mobile embedded(Iot) applications.
- Supports Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, IOS, Windows Phone devices
- Mainly used in Xamarin and Aps.Net Core
- Open Source (via MIT License)
- Contains the class library, wich is a subset of .NetFramework
- Doesn't contain any Windows-specific classes/ runtime services
- C#/VB.NEt can used for writing code of .Net Core
