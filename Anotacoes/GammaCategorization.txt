- Design Patterns are typically split into three categories
- This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.

Creational Patterns
- Deal with tre creation(construction) of objects.
- Explicit(constructor) vs implicit(DI, reflection, etc).
- Wholesale(sigle statement) vs piecewise(step-by-step).

Structural Patterns
- Concerned with the structure(class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design

Behavioral Patterns
- Theu are all differente, no central theme.
