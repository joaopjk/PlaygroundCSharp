When it's easier to copy an existing object to fully initialize a new one.

Motivation
- Complicated objects aren't designed from scratch
- An existing(partially of fully constructed) design is a Prototype
- We make a copy(clone) the Prototype and customized it
- We make the cloning convenient(via Factory)
