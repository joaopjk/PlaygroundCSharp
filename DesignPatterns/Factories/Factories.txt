Motivation
- Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
- Constructor is not descriptive
	- Name mandated by name of containing type
	- Cannot overload with same sets of argumentes with diferrente names
	- Can turn into 'optional parameter hell'
- Object creation(non-piecewire, unlike Builder) can be outsourced
	- A separete function(Factory Method)
	- That may exist in a separete class(factory)
	- Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory
