Motivation
- Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call.
- Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
- Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is no productive.
- Instead, opt for piecewise construction.
- Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.
